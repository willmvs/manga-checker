Script to check the status (Complete/Cancelled/Ongoing) of a list of mangas

Based on the mangaupdates.com website, and the public view of each manga page.
If it breaks, check their HTML for any changes and adjust the script.

In this first version the script relies on a text file containing links to each manga page. One link by line. Example:
https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/axmopy6/jujutsu-kaisen
https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/stwyptc/nanatsu-no-taizai

You can create your own list of mangas on mangaupdates.com and later copy the links
from the My Lists page using a browser extension, like Copy Selected Links (Chrome).
